**Docs:** [Buu Philosophy](./docs/philosophy/buu.md) · [ADR: Absorption Model](./docs/adr/0001-buu-absorption-model.md) · [Demo](./DEMO.md)

`oh-my-codex-buu` starts with the `oh-my-codex` runtime body and adds a stronger absorption model inspired by Cell and Majin Buu:

- **Cell layer**: quarantine, digest, provenance, compatibility checking
- **Buu layer**: cocoon whole capability bundles and selectively activate fused forms

This repo is for building a Codex-native orchestration system that can absorb selected external workflows without pretending they were native from the start.

## Current Direction

The first milestone is intentionally conservative:

1. preserve the working OMX core
2. add a typed absorption registry
3. document the philosophy and ADRs
4. absorb selected `oh-my-qwen` ideas only after digestion

## Why Buu

`oh-my-qwen` already encodes a strong **Cell Gate**: fetch, inspect, approve, blend.

That is valuable, but Cell is still a narrow absorber. Buu is the stronger model for this project because Buu can engulf whole systems, retain their powers in cocoons, and activate fused forms later. In software terms:

- a **cocoon** stores absorbed capabilities with provenance
- a **form** activates a chosen set of cocoons
- the **Cell gate** still protects ingestion before activation

## Early Modules

- `src/absorption/registry.ts`
- `src/absorption/cocoon.ts`
- `src/absorption/forms.ts`
- `src/absorption/quarantine.ts`
- `src/absorption/storage.ts`

## Command Surface

The initial package keeps the OMX body and the `omx` CLI surface. The absorption model is an internal capability expansion, not a command rename.

```bash
npm install -g .
omx
```

More specialized Buu-native workflows can come later, but the primary operator interface remains `omx`.

The first real absorption operator surface is:

```bash
omx absorb seed-matrix --write
omx absorb seed-apply
omx absorb activate awake-core omx-core buu-absorption --name "Awake Core"
omx absorb apply oracle-commander
omx absorb list
omx absorb current
omx absorb package reloaded --write
omx absorb import .omx/absorption/packages/reloaded.json
```

`seed-matrix` generates a GSD blueprint:

- **Goals**: what the repo is trying to become
- **Systems**: what execution/runtime surfaces already exist
- **Differentiators**: what makes this OMX fork stronger than baseline

When a local `oh-my-qwen` checkout is available, the seed also suggests Qwen-derived cocoons for the Cell Gate, Oracle memory loop, and controlled workflow pipeline.

Named form profiles:

- `matrix-core`
- `cell-gate`
- `oracle-commander`
- `full-power`

It keeps Codex as the execution engine and makes it easier to:
- start a stronger Codex session by default
- run one consistent workflow from clarification to completion
- invoke the canonical skills with `$deep-interview`, `$ralplan`, `$team`, and `$ralph`
- keep project guidance, plans, logs, and state in `.omx/`

## Recommended default flow

If you want the default OMX experience, start here:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex oh-my-codex
omx setup
omx --madmax --high
```

Then work normally inside Codex:

```text
$deep-interview "clarify the authentication change"
$ralplan "approve the auth plan and review tradeoffs"
$ralph "carry the approved plan to completion"
$team 3:executor "execute the approved plan in parallel"
```

That is the main path.
Start OMX strongly, clarify first when needed, approve the plan, then choose `$team` for coordinated parallel execution or `$ralph` for the persistent completion loop.

## What OMX is for

Use OMX if you already like Codex and want a better day-to-day runtime around it:
- a standard workflow built around `$deep-interview`, `$ralplan`, `$team`, and `$ralph`
- specialist roles and supporting skills when the task needs them
- project guidance through scoped `AGENTS.md`
- durable state under `.omx/` for plans, logs, memory, and mode tracking

If you want plain Codex with no extra workflow layer, you probably do not need OMX.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Codex CLI installed: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- Codex auth configured
- `tmux` on macOS/Linux if you want the recommended durable team runtime
- `psmux` on native Windows only if you intentionally want the less-supported Windows team path

### A good first session

Launch OMX the recommended way:

```bash
omx --madmax --high
```

This starts the interactive leader session directly by default.
If you explicitly want the leader session in tmux, use:

```bash
omx --tmux --madmax --high
```

Then try the canonical workflow:

```text
$deep-interview "clarify the authentication change"
$ralplan "approve the safest implementation path"
$ralph "carry the approved plan to completion"
$team 3:executor "execute the approved plan in parallel"
```

Use `$team` when the approved plan needs coordinated parallel work, or `$ralph` when one persistent owner should keep pushing to completion.

## A simple mental model

OMX does **not** replace Codex.

It adds a better working layer around it:
- **Codex** does the actual agent work
- **OMX role keywords** make useful roles reusable
- **OMX skills** make common workflows reusable
- **`.omx/`** stores plans, logs, memory, and runtime state

Most users should think of OMX as **better task routing + better workflow + better runtime**, not as a command surface to operate manually all day.

## Start here if you are new

1. Run `omx setup`
2. Launch with `omx --madmax --high`
3. Use `$deep-interview "..."` when the request or boundaries are still unclear
4. Use `$ralplan "..."` to approve the plan and review tradeoffs
5. Choose `$team` for coordinated parallel execution or `$ralph` for persistent completion loops

## Recommended workflow

1. `$deep-interview` — clarify scope when the request or boundaries are still vague.
2. `$ralplan` — turn that clarified scope into an approved architecture and implementation plan.
3. `$team` or `$ralph` — use `$team` for coordinated parallel execution, or `$ralph` when you want a persistent completion loop with one owner.

## Common in-session surfaces

| Surface | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `$deep-interview "..."` | clarifying intent, boundaries, and non-goals |
| `$ralplan "..."` | approving the implementation plan and tradeoffs |
| `$ralph "..."` | persistent completion and verification loops |
| `$team "..."` | coordinated parallel execution when the work is big enough |
| `/skills` | browsing installed skills and supporting helpers |

## Advanced / operator surfaces

These are useful, but they are not the main onboarding path.

### Team runtime

Use the team runtime when you specifically need durable tmux/worktree coordination, not as the default way to begin using OMX.

```bash
omx team 3:executor "fix the failing tests with verification"
omx team status <team-name>
omx team resume <team-name>
omx team shutdown <team-name>
```

### Setup, doctor, and HUD

These are operator/support surfaces:
- `omx setup` installs prompts, skills, AGENTS scaffolding, `.codex/config.toml`, and OMX-managed native Codex hooks in `.codex/hooks.json`
  - setup refresh preserves non-OMX hook entries in `.codex/hooks.json` and only rewrites OMX-managed wrappers
  - `omx uninstall` removes OMX-managed wrappers from `.codex/hooks.json` but keeps the file when user hooks remain
- `omx doctor` verifies the install when something seems wrong
- `omx hud --watch` is a monitoring/status surface, not the primary user workflow

For non-team sessions, native Codex hooks are now the canonical lifecycle surface:
- `.codex/hooks.json` = native Codex hook registrations
- `.omx/hooks/*.mjs` = OMX plugin hooks
- `omx tmux-hook` / notify-hook / derived watcher = tmux + runtime fallback paths

See [Codex native hook mapping](./docs/codex-native-hooks.md) for the current native / fallback matrix.

### Explore and sparkshell

- `omx explore --prompt "..."` is for read-only repository lookup
- `omx sparkshell <command>` is for shell-native inspection and bounded verification
- when `.omx/wiki/` exists, `omx explore` can inject wiki-first context before falling back to broader repository search

Examples:

```bash
omx explore --prompt "find where team state is written"
omx sparkshell git status
omx sparkshell --tmux-pane %12 --tail-lines 400
```

### Wiki

- `omx wiki` is the CLI parity surface for the OMX wiki MCP server
- wiki data lives locally under `.omx/wiki/`
- the wiki is markdown-first and search-first, not vector-first

Examples:

```bash
omx wiki list --json
omx wiki query --input '{"query":"session-start lifecycle"}' --json
omx wiki lint --json
omx wiki refresh --json
```

### Platform notes for team mode

`omx team` works best on macOS/Linux with `tmux`.
Native Windows remains a secondary path, and WSL2 is generally the better choice if you want a Windows-hosted setup.
On native Windows, OMX accepts `psmux` as the tmux-compatible binary for the existing tmux-backed paths it already uses.

| Platform | Install |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `brew install tmux` |
| Ubuntu/Debian | `sudo apt install tmux` |
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install tmux` |
| Arch | `sudo pacman -S tmux` |
| Windows | `winget install psmux` |
| Windows (WSL2) | `sudo apt install tmux` |

## Known issues

### Intel Mac: high `syspolicyd` / `trustd` CPU during startup

On some Intel Macs, OMX startup — especially with `--madmax --high` — can spike `syspolicyd` / `trustd` CPU usage while macOS Gatekeeper validates many concurrent process launches.

If this happens, try:
- `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine $(which omx)`
- adding your terminal app to the Developer Tools allowlist in macOS Security settings
- using lower concurrency (for example, avoid `--madmax --high`)
